## Project Statement:
The primary objective of this project is to develop a personalized screen reader speed adjustment system that can adapt to individual user preferences and provide insights into their reading behavior and log this data for continuous improvement. The primary objective of this project is to develop a personalized screen reader speed adjustment system tailored to individual user preferences. This system aims to enhance the reading experience for users with visual impairments by dynamically adapting the reading speed based on user interactions and collecting data on reading behavior.
## Architecture:

## Implementation:
# Logger.py
The Logger.py file is responsible for logging the screen reader data and print that in the console.

Steps for using Logger.py:

Step 1: Download Logger.py from GitHub, Go to Hidden icons in the taskbar and right click on the NVDA symbol. Select preferences → settings.

Step 2:  Now select Advanced, Click on checkbox “I understand that changing these settings may cause NVDA to function incorrectly” and click on checkbox “Enable loading custom code from Developer Scratchpad” and select open developer scratchpad directory.

Step 5 : To view the logs, select tools → view log

## DataSet

The data set is generated from the data logged from the screen reader. The link for the dataset is given here.

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1shU5l0txL9kqvOpZj3SnUq6G9W9qvQdQ/view?usp=sharing

The dataset has the below columns

*Start Time and End Time:*

These columns record the times at which users begin and end reading or interacting with content. The times are given in a format that likely represents hours, minutes, seconds, and frames (hh:mm:ss:ff).

*Content Type:*

This column categorizes the nature of the content each user is interacting with, such as journals, movies, magazines, newspapers, research papers, and e-commerce.

*User ID:*

This column identifies the user who is interacting with the content, which can be useful for analyzing user-specific behavior or preferences.

*Text Read:*

This column contains a brief snippet or description of the content being read or interacted with. This could provide context or highlights of the content, summarizing its essence or purpose.

# Model Training

The Model training and content categorization information can be found here.

The predictions generated by the RandomForestRegressor model revealed insightful correlations between content types and optimal reading speeds.

## Automatic Speed Adjustment

**Adjustment.py**

Step 1: Download Adjustment.py from GitHub, Go to Hidden icons in the taskbar and right click on the NVDA symbol. Select preferences → settings.

Step 2:  Now select Advanced, Click on checkbox “I understand that changing these settings may cause NVDA to function incorrectly” and click on checkbox “Enable loading custom code from Developer Scratchpad” and select open developer scratchpad directory.

Step 3: Upload the lAdjustment.py file in global plugins.

Step 4 : After uploading select tools → Reload plugins.

The NVDA will proceed with the speed adjustments.

# Results & Conclusion
**Model Implementation and Outcomes**

**Model Used:** RandomForestRegressor

**Key Findings:**

Predicted varying speed multipliers for different content types effectively, aligning with user preferences for complexity and familiarity.

High correlation between model predictions and user feedback confirmed the accuracy of speed adjustments.

**Impact on User Experience**

Increased Accessibility: Customized speed adjustments improved digital content access for visually impaired users.

Enhanced Reading Comfort: Adaptive speeds made reading various content types more comfortable and enjoyable.

The project has enhanced the adaptability and personalization of screen readers using machine learning, improving reading experiences for visually impaired users. Future efforts will aim to refine 

these predictions and broaden the model's applicability.
